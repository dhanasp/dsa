What is linked list?
 - A list where nodes are linked together.
 - each node contains pointer and next node referenace
 - uses dynamic memory
Node 1       Node 2       Node 3
+------+    +------+    +------+
|  10  |    |  20  |    |  30  |
| next |--> | next |--> | null |
+------+    +------+    +------+   

In this example, each node contains a value (10, 20, and 30) and a 
reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null, indicating the end of the list.
