What is an array ?

    - linear data structure where all the elements are sequentailly arranged
    - collection of similar items stored in a fixed location in memory
    - Each element in an array has a unique identifier called an index. start with 0
    - because of indexing, we can access any element in the array quickly.

Intiate array - 

const a = [1,2,3,4]


Types of arrays - 
    1. On the basis of memory allocations - 
    - static   :
        Arrays whose size is fix, It cannot alter or update. Compile-time array - mostly used more efficient memory usage

    - Dynamic  : 
        Arrays whose size is not fixed and can change run time.
    1. On the basis of Dimension - 
    - One Dimensional - row like array, where all the elements stored one after another.
    - Multi Dimensional - mostly used in storing complex data structure like table. (2D, 3D, 4D)


- Operations on arrays - 

1. Array traversal - visiting all the elements of the array once
    code - 
        let elements = [1,2,3,4,5]
        for(a in elements)
        console.log(a)
2. Insertion - Inserting one or multiple elements at any position in the array
    Code - 
        let elements = [1,2,3,4,5]
        elements.splice(2,0,6)

3. Deletion in Array - Remove specific element from an Array
    code - 
        let elements =[1,2,3,4,5]
        removeEle =(index, array)=>{
            res = []
            for(i=0; i>elements.length; i++){
                        if(i != index){
                            res.push(elements[i])
                        }
            }
            return res
        }
